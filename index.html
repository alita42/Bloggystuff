     This video made me even more excited to be a part of the DBC experience. I already had an idea of the what Karim calls the Kitchen mindset before, 
but I think he really made it clear what the difference is between feeling like you are a part of something bigger vs. feeling like you are
a consumer of goods. I have always responded well to an "all in it together" mindset. It's always been my favorite part of a job or a project. 
I loved participating in the theater program in my high school because it truly felt like we were all in it together and everyone must do what they 
can to make the production the best it can be. I have realized lately that the problems in my education have stemmed from a lack of this mindset.
Not just in lecture classes where the expectation is to consume what you ordered from the menu and move along, but in small discussion courses too.
The teacher may not be serving us knowledge in that case, but the self- stratification of fellow students made it difficult to feel an comeraderie.
    </p>
    <p>
        
This brings in the other point Karim makes about the two fears of people coming into Dev Bootcamp. They are either afraid of not performing
as well as the other students and dragging others down, or performing much better than the other students and dragging others along. I was 
keenly aware of being in the first camp in college, which was also a self-fulfilling prophecy. It is exciting to know that DBC is a culture
which understands and allows for both fears. I feel like the problems in a college discussion course of students stratifying themselves in 
this way is the responsibility of the teacher to curtail that behavior and make sure that everyone is equal. I am excited to hear that DBC
values this equality so highly and works to fight against both the imposter syndrome and a destructive overconfidence.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am so excited to spend the next few months working with people who share these values and strive for these ideals. I will confess,
it makes me nervous too. I have not always been very effective at knowing exactly when imposter syndrome comes into play in my life, nor
when I slip into a consumer mindset. I feel confident, though, that DBC will help me be more aware of these things and better able to 
change them.
